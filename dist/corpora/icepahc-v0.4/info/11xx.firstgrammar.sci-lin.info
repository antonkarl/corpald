Edition:	The modernized spelling which appears is primarily taken from:
		http://malvis.hi.is/grein.php?id=77

		Our changes and corrections to that edition, however, follow:
		"Hreinn Benediktsson. 1972. The First Grammatical Treatise.
                University of Iceland. Publications in Linguistics.
                Institute of Nordic Linguistics."

		Note that modern spelling has *not* been used for any words or characters which the author uses specifically as examples in order to illustrate particular points of phonetics or phonology.  For these examples the words appear exactly as closely as possible to how they appear in the manuscript, and they are accompanied by lemmata in modern spelling.
